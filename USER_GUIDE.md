- **40-59%**: AI Explorer - Basic foundation, significant development needed
- **0-39%**: AI Starter - Beginning of journey, foundational work required

---

**Q: Is a lower score bad?**

A: Not at all! The assessment is diagnostic, not judgmental. A lower score simply identifies areas for improvement and helps prioritize efforts. Everyone starts somewhere.

---

A: Your results include industry benchmark comparisons. The radar chart shows:

Your results page states whether you're above, at, or below industry average.

---

**Q: Why are some pillars weighted more than others?**
